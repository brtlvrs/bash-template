# bash-template

This BASH script is to be used as a template for writing BASH scripts.
It demonstrates a structured way of writing BASH scripts, where functions are placed in their own respective files and categorized in folders. All functions are sourced by sourcing the functions.sh script directly in the functions folder
For ease of use some functions that are commonly used in scripts are already written. You only needd to change them.
